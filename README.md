# Denovo
Denovo is a stand alone bitcoin client written in 100% C# from scratch and without any dependencies.  

Current version is `0.0.0.0`, check the [versioning convention](https://github.com/Autarkysoft/Conventions/blob/master/Versioning.md)
for more information, until the release of first beta the code should be considered unsafe-to-use.  
For now the focus is on the "backend" that is the library that will be known as `Bitcoin.Net` or simply `Bitcoin` and will be released
as a Nuget package with the long name `Autarkysoft.Bitcoin`.
